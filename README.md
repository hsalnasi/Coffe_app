# ☕ Coffee App – My 15-Day Flutter Journey  

Just me, vibing with Flutter for 15 days, building this cute little Coffee Android app. Trying to **learn Flutter basics**, play with **widgets**, and see if I can make something that doesn’t totally crash 😅

## 📚 What I’m Following

- **[Net Ninja Flutter Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDKgJEvhaP8&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9giLVXCHSQmWqlHc9BLXdVx&index=9)** – my main guide  
- **[Official Flutter Docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/)** – because sometimes you gotta read the real stuff  
- **ChatGPT** 🥲 – my not-so-silent coding buddy

## 🚀 Stuff I’ve Built So Far

- Simple **UI with Stateless & Stateful Widgets**  
- Clean code by **splitting screens & widgets**  


*(It’s just a learning project, so it’s gonna grow ✨)*

## 🛠 How to Run This App

1. Install **Flutter SDK**: [Flutter Setup](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)  
2. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hsalnasi/Coffe_app.git
cd Coffe_app
```
Get dependinces :
```bash
flutter pub get
```
Run it :

flutter run
```

## 🌟 What I’m Learning

- How the **widget tree** works  
- Separating code so it’s not chaos  
- Handling **state** like a boss  
- Making something **visually okay-ish** for Android
